# Exercise 4: external data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Use the `read.csv()` functoin to read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv`
# file into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv()`
# Be sure to set your working directory in RStudio, and do NOT treat strings as 
# factors!
grants <- read.csv("data/gates_money.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Use the View function to look at the loaded data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `organization` that contains the `organization` column of 
# the dataset
organization <- grants[["organization"]]

# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` 
# function. 
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!
is.vector(organization)

## Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset

# What was the mean grant value?
mean(grants[["total_amount"]]) #2600197

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
max(grants[["total_amount"]]) #100000000

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
min(grants[["total_amount"]]) #5000

# Which organization received the largest grant?
grants[grants["total_amount"] == max(grants["total_amount"]), "organization"] #"Hillsborough County Public Schools"

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
grants[grants["total_amount"] == min(grants["total_amount"]), "organization"] #"New Mexico Business Roundtable for Educational Excellence"

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
nrow(grants[grants["start_year"] == "2010", ]) #18
